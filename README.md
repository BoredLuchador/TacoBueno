# Taco Bueno

Taco Bueno is a partially open source bot that is under development. 
This does not focuses on features that every bot has, rather instead going for the features that would make your server more smooth.

# features

- Snitching on bad people using `report`
- Allowing mobile users to set the channel as nsfw with `nsfw`
- Sending the Bee Movie script to your dms with `beemoviescript`
- Lets you confess annonmously (privacy is not garunteed if the server has a message logs)
- Random Brawl Stars themed command made with the help of the Prawl Stars Bot
- Getting random images from Reddit
- Getting other sick with `infect`
- Finding weather info from random places with `weather`

### How to get started

1) Ping the bot to get the prefix
2) Get the help page using the `help` command
3) Start punching your keyboard to make the bot do stuff
4) Try to find out why there are some hidden options within random commands

## Commands
They are found in the help command and listing them here would be very inefficient.

## Support Server

- Getting into the server requires you to wait for a while
- The server is the go to place to contact the devs if you find a bug or want to suggest a feature

## Bot Hosting

Due to the fact that I do not use Windows or Mac, you are on your own when it goes to hosting the bot since I do not know how to help you. 

## Issues and suggestions

I do not check Github very often, so please open a ticket in the support server. Since this bot is being developed by a single person using a toaster, expect fixes to be slow unless you can help out by submitting code changes.
