### Getting Started

1) Invite the bot to the server
2) Ping the bot to get the prefix

4) Start punching your keyboard to make the bot do stuff
5) Try to find out why there are some hidden options within random commands

# Info 
## Self Hosting

Due to the fact that I do not use Windows or Mac, you are on your own when it goes to hosting the bot since I do not know how to help you, other than tell you to create an `.env` file and put your token there.

Make sure you pick a good host and send them the correct info.

## Support and Suggestions

###  Github
You can open an issue in Github. Make sure you also send a error message if you revieved any from the bot. Since I am working from a toaster, feel free to give me some ideas or create a pull request to contribite to the project
### Discord
This would be a more direct way to contact me for support, just know that I will have a much harder time managing through this server.
